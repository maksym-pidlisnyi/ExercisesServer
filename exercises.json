    "description":"Place a barbell in a squat rack so that the bar is slightly lower than shoulder height, and grip the bar with the hands about shoulder-width apart. Dip under the bar to lift it up and rest it on the front of shoulders, then step back away from the rack. Place the feet hip-width apart, and bend at the knees while keeping the back straight. Quickly press the feet into the floor and snap the hips forward while pushing the weight directly overhead with the elbows facing away from the body. Slowly lower the barbell to the shoulders and repeat. The power for moving the weight should come from the hips and transfer through the shoulders and arms.",

Press the feet into the ground and the hips into the bench while lifting the bar off the rack. Slowly lower the bar to the chest by allowing the elbows to bend out to the side. Stop when the elbows are just below the bench, and press feet into the floor to press the weight straight up to return to the starting position.",

Place the cable pulley at about shoulder-height, attach a rope handle, and hold one end of the rope in each hand with the palms facing down. Turn to face the machine. Lift the chest up and pull the elbows back until the hands are right in front of the shoulders, then pause for 2-3 seconds. Slowly straighten the arms to return the weight to the starting position.",

    "description":"Place a barbell in a rack at about shoulder-height. Dip under the bar so that it rests behind the neck across the top of the back and shoulder blades, and grip the bar with the hands just outside the shoulders. Raise the chest and squeeze the shoulder blades together to maintain a straight back throughout the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and step backwards, placing both feet approximately hip-width apart and squarely set on the floor with the toes pointed forward. (Tip: for more development on the outside of calves point feet slightly inwards.) Keep a slight bend in knees, and press the toes into the ground while lifting the heels up. Pause at the top, and slowly roll the heels back down to the floor, then pause again and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
